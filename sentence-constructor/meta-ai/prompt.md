    - BAD: the beginner sentence is unnecessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table
    - BAD: the possible sentence structure is confusing, it says too much, we really want something that is conceptual
    </score_reasons>

    Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts and work on translating it into Russian.
