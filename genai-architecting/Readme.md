## Functional Requirements

The company wants to invest in owning their infrastuctue.
The reason is because there is a concern about the privacy of user data and also a concern that the cost of managed services for GenAI will greatly raise in cost.

They want to invest an AI PC where they can afford  spend of 10-15K.
They have 300 active students, and students are located within the city of Moscow.

## Assumptions

We are assuming that the Open-source LLMs that we choose will be powerful enough to run on hardware with an investment of 10-15K.


We're going to hook up a single server in our office to the internet, and we should have enough bandwidth to serve 300 students.

## Data Strategy

There is a concern of copyrighted materials, so we must purchase and supply materials and store them for access in our database.

## Considerations

We're considering using IBM Granite because its a trully open-source model with training data that is traceable so we can avoid any copyright issues and we're able to know what is going on in the model.
